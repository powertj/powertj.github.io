I'm a Research Engineer at [Google DeepMind](https://deepmind.google/). 

I completed my PhD in Robotics at the University of Michigan where I worked at the [ARM](http://arm.eecs.umich.edu/#) lab, advised by [Dmitry Berenson](http://web.eecs.umich.edu/~dmitryb/). During my PhD, I worked on applying deep generative models (normalising flows, diffusion models) to accelerate planning & trajectory optimisation. I previously interned at Honda Research Institute USA where I worked on dexterous manipulation.
