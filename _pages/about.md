I'm a PhD student in Robotics at the University of Michigan. I work at the [ARM](http://arm.eecs.umich.edu/#) lab, advised by [Dmitry Berenson](http://web.eecs.umich.edu/~dmitryb/). I previously interned at Honda Research Institute USA. I received my MEng in mechanical engineering from Imperial College London in 2016.

I am interested in applying tools from planning, trajectory optimization, and machine learning to robot manipulation problems. During my PhD, I have developed algorithms using the planning-as-inference paradigm and deep generative models to accelerate trajectory optimization.
